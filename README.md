*Network and IT Infrastructure Studies*
This repository showcases my studies and various scenarios related to networking, protocols, and IT infrastructure. Here, you will find practical examples and explorations of key concepts, with a focus on:

   Networking Protocols: Analysis and implementation of various network protocols.
   Infrastructure Solutions: Real-world scenarios and architectures for IT infrastructure.
   Best Practices: Approaches to building secure, scalable, and efficient network environments.
    
Feel free to explore, contribute, or ask questions as I continue to expand my knowledge and skills in these areas.
